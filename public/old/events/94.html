<p><span class="caps">PRESENTATIONS</span>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>&#8220;Ruby Hangman: April Fools Special&#8221; &#8212; Markus Roberts will confound and amaze you with his <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pdxruby/browse_thread/thread/f1cd7ffe4c2e4517">latest puzzle</a></li>
	<li>&#8220;Machine Learning and Data Mining Using Ruby&#8221; &#8212; Randall Thomas will present a quick and dirty introduction to machine learning and data mining, describe effective ways to apply these, and show how to make use of these using Ruby. Randall works at Engine Yard, is a classically-trained musician, tinkers with robotics, and enjoys coding with Ruby, Erlang and OCaml.</li>
	<li>&#8220;Ruby fixture replacement issues and factory_girl tutorial&#8221; &#8212; Igal Koshevoy will provide an overview of the Ruby tools, methods and divergent needs discussed at our recent fixture replacements meetup.

	<li>&#8220;Mid-month unstructured activity meetup discussion&#8221;  &#8212; The meetup to discuss fixtures replacement was a big success. I&#8217;d like to have more similar events in between regular meetings.</li>
