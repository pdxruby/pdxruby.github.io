## History

This incarnation of the site uses Jekyll and is hosted on Github Pages. The content was ported verbatim from the previous incarnation of the site, which used Dokuwiki.

There is also an older version of the site, archived as static html at https://github.com/pdxruby/pdxruby.archive and included in this site as a Git Submoduleat [/old](old/). If you want to be able to browse the archive in your local copy, you'll need to run:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
