The **Portland Ruby Brigade**, also known as **pdxruby** and **pdx.rb**,
is a user group for Ruby programmers in the Portland, Oregon area. The
group welcomes all programmers interested in the language and its
implementations, tools, libraries and frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails.
The group has been meeting since August 2002 for presentations, demos
and discussions applicable to all skill levels, from newbies and
experts. Twice every month people come together to share their knowledge,
projects and enthusiasm for Ruby – join us!

### Meeting Times

Each first Tuesday of the month we have a virtual hangout over Zoom where we get to know each other, discuss projects we're working on, share interesting content, and sometimes watch a recorded technical presentation as a launching pad for conversation.

Each third Thursday of the month we meet at the White Owl Social Club in Portland's Central Eastside for socializing and informal networking.
