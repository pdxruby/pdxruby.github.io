The **Portland Ruby Brigade**, also known as **pdxruby** and **pdx.rb**,
is a user group for Ruby programmers in the Portland, Oregon area. The
group welcomes all programmers interested in the language and its
implementations, tools, libraries and frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails.
The group has been meeting since August 2002 for presentations, demos
and discussions applicable to all skill levels, from newbies and
experts. Every month 100+ people come together to share their knowledge,
projects and enthusiasm for Ruby – join us!
