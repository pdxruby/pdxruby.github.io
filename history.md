History
=======

**pdxruby** has been a gathering place for local technology and open source culture enthusiasts for over ten years. Much has happened over these years and members of the group have started many important projects, groups and events that have become the foundations of our present-day Portland tech community. pdxruby isn't merely a user group, but an open source culture incubator.
